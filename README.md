Android app that allows user to mark a location's GPS coordinates, then continually points the user back to the location and gives a distance measure. Uses Android fragments.

Zipped file is the entire Android project. For convenience I also committed the java source code and XML file for the main activity and fragment layouts.

There is a known bug where the arrow in the second fragment, which is supposed to point to the marked location, rotates correctly but resizes after every rotate and thus is not entirely visible.
